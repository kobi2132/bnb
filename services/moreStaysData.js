The view from most of the rooms really raised the bar of our stay. There were many interesting ocean trails nearby and the short walk into town was scenic. Our stay here was one of the highlights of the vacation. It was well worth the two-hour drive from Barcelona!",

The house has a lot of glass and in the middle of summer would benefit from air conditioning (something mentioned in previous reviews), but has large windows which can be opened. The coast line is incredible, and this property is perfectly located to maximise the views. Would recommend a visit to the local monastery if nothing else for the amazing drive from the property.",
